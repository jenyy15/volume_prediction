# Volume Prediction

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the daily trading volume of equities.

## Data Source

The data used in this project was sourced from BARRA, FactSet, and other proprietary sources as part of a company case study. Due to confidentiality reasons, the original dataset cannot be shared.

If you wish to reproduce the results or experiment with the model, you may generate synthetic data or use publicly available datasets with a similar structure.

## Disclaimer

This project was completed as part of a take-home interview challenge. All code and analysis are my own work. No proprietary data or company-sensitive information is included in this repository.
